<ol>
	<li>
		Answer the question at every checkpoint to reveal the three possible choices. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Of the three choices, one of them is the most efficient way out of that situation, one is a detour and one is a dead end.
	</li>
	<li>
		When the player selects the most efficient checkpoint - he gains a superpower. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Every detour redirects to the most efficient solution after answering another question, but no superpowers are gained upon selecting a detour.
	</li>
	<li>
		Every dead end results in a time lag - unless the player chooses to use a superpower.
	</li>
	<li>
		The answers are not case sensitive.
	</li>
	<li>
		Units of the solutions are not required.
	</li>
	<li>
		White spaces are not allowed.
